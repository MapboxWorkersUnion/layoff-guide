# General Information

## This is not legal advice
We'll do our best to compile information around what legal rights an employee in the US has while being fired, but no information in this guide is meant as an appropriate substitute for the advice of a qualified legal professional. Unfortunately, when an individual loses their job, they may not be in a position to pay for legal services. This dynamic forces many workers to navigate confusing legal documents in isolation. We hope that by compiling some learnings around our legal experiences, we can arm individuals with the knowledge they might need to protect their employment rights. This guide specifically focuses on workers employed in the private sector.

## Who oversees labor law in the US?
Many labor issues are segmented across departments. Fortunately, though, the individuals at these departments are often willing to point you in the right direction. Below is a broad overview. We'll cover those legal issues especially pertinant to employee terminations in greater detail in the rest of this guide.

# Important Laws Surrounding Dismissal

## 1) Layoffs

### [The WARN Act](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/Layoff/pdfs/WorkerWARN2003.pdf)
The WARN Act says that employees must receive a **written notice 60 days** before a mass layoff. There are many execptions and conditions to this law that make it difficult to understand and interpret.

- Only companies with **100** or more total US employees must follow this requirement
- Those employees must be **full time workers** with more than **6 months** tenure at this company to count as a company with "100 or more employees". Part-time employees or newer employees may be eligible for shorter notice periods.
- A "mass layoff" has a somewhat challenging definition: 
  - Typically includes 50 or more US workers laid off within a 30 day period
  - Those 50 workers must be coming from a 'single site'
    - This gets tricky with remote employment -- if your job is remote, your 'single site' may be:
      - The location to which you're assigned as a 'home base'
      - The location from which you're assigned duties
      - The location to which you report
- Many employers prefer to pay 60-days severance upon termination as an alternative to delivering a written WARN notice. This technically is not compliant with the WARN act, but *is* compliant with the penalty for violating the WARN act (which is 60 days' backpay and all benefits).
- Many states have ['mini-WARN' acts](https://edd.ca.gov/en/Jobs_and_Training/Layoff_Services_WARN) which are more stringent or strict in nature -- they may require smaller numbers of people impacted to trigger a WARN notice, for example.
- There are a number of 'loopholes' that may allow an employer to knowingly violate the WARN act: they may have been seeking funding and giving notice would jeopardize that funding, they may have unreasonable business conditions that prevent them from giving notice, or a natural disaster. 
- The US Department of Labor or state departments of labor do _not_ enforce WARN. Workers and their representatives must pursue the WARN act through _private right of action_, which is essentially a lawsuit within US court systems with private attorneys. If workers win their case, judges will often assign any legal fees to the former employer.
