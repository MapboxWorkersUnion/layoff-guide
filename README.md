# Introduction

_This guide is intended to serve as a reference for understanding the many new concepts and complicated processes to navigate during a difficult time. Nothing in this guide serves as a substitute for legal and financial advice from a qualified professional. We'll do our best to include past learnings, but the authors of this guide are not able to deliver legal advice, only legal information. This legal information is only applicable to US Residents, where the authors have experience._

## Why did we write this guide?

Unemployment is difficult, isolating, and emotionally taxing. At the same time as an individual struggles with the loss of a job, they will need to be able to rapidly understand and process things like legal, financial, and healthcare situations.

Mapbox, in particular, has left the authors of this guide with little information, causing such authors to have to learn how to advocate for themselves in ways that have had lasting consequences. This guide is a collection of our past learnings.
