# General

Unemployment Insurance (also called Unemployment Income or Unemployment Benefits --  we'll call it 'income' in this guide) is a US joint state-federal program by which individuals who lose employment through no fault of their own can receive temporary income. The US Federal Government creates laws surrounding the unemployment program, while individual states administer and manage the disbursement of funds. Unemployment Income is a form of social insurance. Funds are raised through payroll taxes imposed on businesses. Everyone who qualifies should file for unemployment, irrespective of existing assets or the expected length of unemployment.

## How much income can I receive?
States set minimum and maximum benefit income limits and then calculate individual income amounts based on your 'base period'. For many workers, unemployment income is calculated to be about 33-50% of their annual income, allocated weekly. The total amount at the end of 6 months could range from $6,000 (Mississippi) to $21,000 (Massachusetts). This maximum can increase in times of national/local emergency - such as with the 2020 pandemic.

# How to file

## Where do I find the application for Unemployment Income?

State Departments of Labor typically allow individuals to file online. [Find your state application here](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits/find-unemployment-benefits.aspx). 

## What's the application process?

Most states will have an 'initial claim' application, where you'll submit your information and information about any employer(s) you may have had in the past 12-18 months. This can be done online, over the phone, or (sometimes) in office. Once an initial claim has been established, reviewed, and approved, you will need to file a weekly claim for every week that you remain unemployed.

## What information will I need to file an initial claim?

State requirements will vary, but most states will ask for the following identification information:

- Social Security Number (or Alien Registration documentation if you are not a US citizen)
- Mailing/Home addresses
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Amount and Duration of any separation pay you may receive
- Driver's License Number or State ID Number
- Banking Information for a Direct Deposit
- Military Forms or Form SF-8 for Federal Government employees

For each employer from the past 12-18 months, your application may ask:

- Name and Address for the workplace
- Payroll Address (if different)
- Employer telephone number
- Beginning and End dates of employment
- Reason for separation

## What information will I need to file for my weekly claim?

Each state's questions and requirements may be a little different, but generally, the application will want to confirm the following information (for the past week):

- If you were able and available to work
- If you refused an offer of work
- If you quit a job
- If you were fired from a job
- If you received a backpay or settlement
- If you received worker's compensation, vacation pay, or Wages in Lieu of Notice
- If you looked for work as directed/required by your state
- If you performed any work or earned any wages

## Anything else I should know about the application process?

- Depending on your state's requirements, you may have to submit proof of your ongoing job search through web addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. It's best to keep this information in a spreadsheet for your records and to make the weekly claim as easy as possible.
  
- Most states have a 'verification' process where a Department of Labor employee calls to ask you for additional information about your application. 

- Sometimes, former employers can challenge your unemployment claim. Employers can be penalized or asked to pay higher taxes if too many former employees file claims 'against' them. Ultimately, employers don't have the unilateral authority to _deny_ a claim. The state Department of Labor makes the final decision. If you are rejected for Unemployment Income, you can appeal that decision.

- Often, you will hear the advice to "force your employer to fire you, rather than quitting" to preserve your right to unemployment income. While that general rule of thumb isn't incorrect, being fired doesn't automatically allow you to collect unemployment income (employers can still claim misconduct, for example, which may be a 'justified' firing and may result in you being ineligible for receiving unemployment income), but other times you may still be eligible for unemployment income even when you do quit. 

- If you did receive severance from your employer, _particularly_ in the form of a lump-sum payment, most states would allow you to file for unemployment income the following week after you receive your pay. Make sure this is true for your state. You do still need to report your severance pay on your application accurately.

  -   For example, if you received '5 weeks' of severance as a lump-sum payment, you do _not_ need to wait five weeks to file for unemployment income. You can file the following week after receiving your severance.

# Receiving Unemployment Income

## How will I receive my Unemployment Income?

Most states will directly deposit income into your checking account each week; some offer a debit card service and will deposit into that account. If you want to, you can receive weekly checks in the mail.

## How long can I collect Unemployment Income?

It varies slightly from state to state, but you can (on average) collect for up to 26 weeks in a row.

## How much will I collect?
Again, this amount varies quite a bit from state to state. Generally, states use a 'base period' -- essentially a 3-month period, and they look at your highest earnings from 2 base periods of (roughly) the past year to calculate your unemployment income (a percentage of your highest quarterly earnings). There are some alternative methods used to calculate income if needed.

## Anything Else I should know?

- Unemployment Income is taxable and _must_ be reported as gross income on your federal taxes. You may elect to have state and federal taxes deducted from your weekly unemployment income beforehand. You will be mailed a 1099G for the calendar year you collected income.
- You can collect unemployment income multiple times in your life. You are not limited by the number of times you can collect; you need to have worked at any time in the past 18 months. 

- Many states have requirements about the minimum period that you must have worked in that state to receive unemployment from the state (usually 12-18 months). Remember that if you worked in another state, you may also "roll-together" your work experience in a combined wage claim. It is a good idea to look at the maximum benefit amount in the states where you did work and file with that state.
