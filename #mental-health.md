# Preserving your mental health during unemployment

*Its worth saying off-the-bat that the act(s) of preserving your mental health will truly look different for everyone. There are some commonalities, but individual needs and pressures will necessitate individual responses. This guide is meant to supply baseline ideas, and like many other guides, really cannot subsitute the help of a qualified professional. And yet, like many other guides -- we acknowledge that affording qualified professionals at a time like this will be particularly challenging. Thus, we share our experiences in the hopes that they can help you.*

## The unique challenge of unemployment

Unemployment supplies all the ingredients for a particularly frightening, exhausting, demeaning time in life. Indeed, unemployment is [almost](https://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2015/07/the-top-5-most-stressful-life-events) [universally](https://psychcentral.com/stress/top-10-life-stressors-that-can-trigger-anxiety#top-10-life-stressors) [recognized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996482/) as one of life's major stressors. 

In the US especially, jobs have been ingrained into sense of identity, there are few social safety nets after losing one's job, and in may lead to additional stressors over time. 

People can and often do respond in a variety of ways, and may respond differently at different points of their unemployment.

## Acceptance

Layoffs or even firings are rarely the fault of the individual -- yet the individual is the one who suffers consequences. Accept that you (probably) did nothing wrong, and that there wasn't much that you as an individual could have done differently. Accept that your employer will treat you however they've pre-determined to treat you. 

Accept that this time-period will be hard, and frustrating, and that you'll have bad interviews or weird interactions with hiring teams. Accept that at times you might have strained relationships because you're going through this particularly hard thing and you don't know how to stop it from infecting the ones around you. Accept that you're mostly a good person who's trying their best and cannot _will_ your employment into existence. (Or else you already would've done that). Accept that this just really, really sucks. 

What I mean when I encourage you to accept this, is that there's no reason to pressure yourself into being a certain way, responding a certain way, achieving certain milestones. You're going to feel what you're going to feel. And that's ok.

## What research says about mental health during unemployment

## 1) [Normalizing unemployment as neutral or even potentially positive plays a role in lasting postive mental health.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0033294118794410?journalCode=prxa) 

This concept may seem overly simple, but an understanding of your  own frustrations and how to counteract them (as well as _why_ it's important to counteract negative emotions) provides a foundational base for maintaining day-to-day mental/emotional hygiene. 


### What is normalization?

Essentially, the process by which a specific behavior or circumstance becomes 'within the norm' for a group of people. 

### How does it apply here?

More and more, unemployment is a commonplace *part* of one's lifelong career. In the US, [the averege tenure at an individual company for both wage and salary workers is 4.1 years](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/tenure.pdf). The way the US measures 'unemployment' (as a monthly macroeconomic *rate*) somewhat conceals how common it is for an indvidiual person to experience unemployment at least once throughout their lives. There aren't a lot of numbers out there, but the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducted a longitudinal survey of youth in 1979 and again in 1997. They estimated that the average Baby Boomer would experience [*5.8* stints of unemployment from age 18-54](https://www.bls.gov/nls/questions-and-answers.htm#anch42). All this to suggest, unemployment is a lot more common than society seems to talk about.

### [Normalization as a coping skill](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.525506/full)

Unemployment comes with both positive and negative emotions -- you may have more free time for loved ones or hobbies or rest, and that next day you may feel demoralized after a particularly difficult interview. Finding ways to "self-soothe" after a negative emotional experience (*personally, I will phone a patient friend and talk until I'm laughing about the ridiculousness of the interview*) as well finding ways to acknowledge and appreciate positive emotional experiences (*for example, actively appreciating a long, scenic bike ride that you would've never had time for on a regular Wednesday*) are both examples of coping with negative emotions.

I find that I'm more able to notice positive experiences for what they are when I'm regularly practicing meditation and gratitude journaling -- both personally help me train my brain to live more in the moment. Your mileage may vary with those individual coping strategies, but it's important to know what _does_ work for you.

There are many other means of normalization -- talking to people about your experiences, sharing resources, developing a litany of "affirmations" (Unemployment is normal, my job status doesn't change my value and it doesn't change who I am, the worth of a human life is one human life). Taking the time to learn which strategies resonate and work for you will ultimately help prepare you with the right tools for when the negative experiences and emotions do strike.
