# Preserving your mental health during unemployment

*It's worth saying off the bat that the act(s) of preserving your mental health will truly look different for everyone. Some commonalities exist, but individual needs and pressures will necessitate individual responses. This guide is meant to supply baseline ideas and, like many other guides, cannot substitute a qualified professional's help. And yet, like many other guides -- we acknowledge that affording qualified professionals at a time like this will be particularly challenging. Thus, we share our experiences in the hopes that they can help you.*

## The unique challenge of unemployment

Unemployment supplies all the ingredients for a particularly frightening, exhausting, demeaning time in life. Indeed, unemployment is [almost](https://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2015/07/the-top-5-most-stressful-life-events) [universally](https://psychcentral.com/stress/top-10-life-stressors-that-can-trigger-anxiety#top-10-life-stressors) [recognized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996482/) as one of life's major stressors. 

In the US, jobs have been ingrained into a sense of identity. In addition, there are few social safety nets after losing one's employment, which may lead to additional stressors over time. 

People can and often do respond in various ways and may react differently at different points of their unemployment.

## Acceptance

Layoffs or even firings are rarely the fault of the individual -- yet the individual is the one who suffers consequences. Accept that you did nothing wrong and that there wasn't much that you as an individual could have done differently. Accept that your employer will treat you however they're determined to treat you. 

Accept that this period will be challenging and frustrating and that you'll have bad interviews or weird interactions with hiring teams. Accept that, at times, you might have strained relationships because you're going through this tricky thing, and you don't know how to stop it from infecting those around you. Accept that you're primarily a good person who's trying their best and cannot _will_ your employment into existence. (Or else you already would've done that). Accept that this just really, really sucks. 

There's no reason to pressure yourself into being a certain way, responding a certain way, or achieving certain milestones. You're going to feel what you're going to feel. And that's okay.

## What the research says about mental health during unemployment

## 1) [Normalizing unemployment as neutral or potentially positive plays a role in lasting positive mental health.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0033294118794410?journalCode=prxa) 

This concept may seem overly simple, but understanding your frustrations and how to counteract them (as well as _why_ it's important to balance negative emotions) provides a foundation for maintaining daily mental/emotional hygiene. 


### What is Normalization?

Essentially, the process by which a specific behavior or circumstance becomes 'within the norm' for a group of people. 

### How does it apply here?

More and more, unemployment is a commonplace *part* of one's lifelong career. In the US, [the average tenure at an individual company for both wage and salary workers is 4.1 years](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/tenure.pdf). The way the US measures 'unemployment' (as a monthly macroeconomic *rate*) conceals how common it is for an individual to experience unemployment at least once throughout their lives. There are few statistics on this, but the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducted a longitudinal youth survey in 1979 and again in 1997. They estimated that the average Baby Boomer would experience [*5.8* stints of unemployment from age 18-54](https://www.bls.gov/nls/questions-and-answers.htm#anch42). So unemployment is a lot more common than society seems to talk about.

### [Normalization as a coping skill](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.525506/full)

Unemployment comes with positive and negative emotions -- you may have more free time for loved ones, hobbies, or rest. But, on the other hand, the next day, you may feel demoralized after a challenging interview. Finding ways to "self-soothe" after a negative emotional experience (*personally, I will phone a patient friend and talk until I'm laughing about the ridiculousness of an interview*) as well as finding ways to acknowledge and appreciate positive emotional experiences (*for example, actively enjoying a long, scenic bike ride that you would've never had time for on a regular Wednesday*) are both examples of coping with negative emotions.

I'm more able to notice positive experiences for what they are when I'm regularly practicing meditation and gratitude journaling -- both personally help me train my brain to live more "in the moment." Of course, your mileage may vary with those individual coping strategies, but knowing what _does_ work for you is crucial.

There are many other means of Normalization -- talking to people about your experiences, sharing resources, developing a litany of "affirmations" (Unemployment is normal, my job status doesn't change my value and it doesn't change who I am, the worth of human life is one human life). However, taking the time to learn which strategies resonate and work for you will ultimately help prepare you with the right tools for when negative experiences and emotions do arise.

## 2) [Your emotional response to job loss may differ daily. Expect to rely on different coping skills at various stages during unemployment](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-41102-001)

The authors of this article segment coping skills into 'problem-related coping' and 'emotion-related coping.' They suggest that those individuals with more substantial, plentiful coping skills would be more likely to obtain re-employment (potentially sooner than those with fewer means of coping). 

### What are coping skills?

[Richard S. Lazarus and Susan Folkman](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Stress,+appraisal,+and+coping&author=RS+Lazarus&author=S+Folkman&publication_year=1984&) were seminal psychologists in the work of understanding Stress and Coping skills, they wrote several fascinating articles and books on where (psychological) stress originates, and how we respond to stress. Their work, as applied to unemployment, describe the sudden jarring change in status, creating a rift between what an individual wants or values in life (employment, income, etc.) and their current life situation (unemployment, lack of stable income). Coping is adapting your thinking and re-arranging your situation until the gap between desired and present status is manageable.

Coping skills will ultimately look different for each person; individuals may need to tailor their coping skillset to their own resources, preferences, and effectiveness of any particular skill. And it's crucial to note that any singular coping skill won't work for every problem. In particular, psychologists often highlight how coping skills are constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts and that effective coping requires regular check-ins (Lazarus and Folkman call them 'appraisals') with your current mental and emotional states and identifying which responses are going to best help you. Sometimes coping skills may be physical/behavioral, cognitive, and sometimes a combination. It's essential to have a comprehensive cache of tools.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) highlights _awareness_ of different emotions to help individuals -- often through non-judgmental recognizing, acknowledging, and even labeling emotions as they experience them.

## Strategies that I've used to keep my mental health more stable while unemployed

I've been fortunate to be unemployed multiple times in my career. Of course, it's always challenging to hear the news and difficult for the first few days afterward. But -- I've also grown accustomed and comfortable with the admittedly _inherently uncomfortable_ unemployment cycle. I know how long it'll last (on average). I know what I need to do to push myself along and when I need a break. It's never a good thing to be unemployed, but I've gotten used to it. 

### The first few weeks
Immediately after learning the news, I've always cried. But that's just me. And then, I genuinely allow myself some time to wallow. I know there's an endpoint to the wallowing; it won't last indefinitely. So I take luxurious midday naps, and sometimes I nap twice a day. I eat the kinds of foods my heart want to eat (sometimes that's cookies, but other times its soup or vegetables -- an attempt to feel a little bit more magnanimous towards myself). Some days I go to the gym and spend a _really_ long lingering time there as if I have nothing better to do-- because I don't. I talk walks and talk on the phone to my mom, my friends, and my family about how this sucks and how I wish it hadn't happened, and what I could have done differently so that this wouldn't happen. They kindly listen and remind me that it'll be okay. I drink CBD sodas and fancy happy drinks.

I want to acknowledge that this period is _really_ indulgent and that I'm so privileged to have this time because I completely recognize that individuals with more responsibilities than I cannot engage in the wallowing weeks. As such, it's important to be kind to yourself, preferably in a way that fits your life. 

I definitely don't apply to jobs at this time, I don't work on my resume (or sometimes I do-- if that's what I really want if that's the way to be kindest to myself), and I don't step foot on LeetCode. But, every single time, I've always needed the break. It always helps me to process and even to grieve. But, this ritual may not work for everyone.

### The time in the middle
I build a cadence of applying, then interviewing (and still applying), then often take-home projects and virtual "on-site" interviews. I usually go through that cycle about once a month and then restart the same process when none of those leads pan out. I cope with the typical rejection by keeping up a regular stream of applications; in the same week that I'm rejected for something I really wanted, I might also have a new opportunity to look forward to, which helps me. I think of it as a "numbers" game. I usually apply to about 200 or so jobs (_minimum_) to receive an offer. 

During this time, I make a point to get outside (usually, I walk) at least once daily. I try to do a workout that I really enjoy. I put an emphasis on feeding myself foods that'll keep me physically and mentally healthy. This slog through applications, interviews, take-homes, whiteboards, and rejections is challenging enough without doing the baseline for my mental and physical health. 

Your baseline, habits, and priorities will look different, but I want to emphasize that the adage 'looking for a job should be your full-time job' doesn't really consider the mental and physical drain of a 40-hour full-time work week. And when I'm going through a period of unemployment, I don't have the capacity to be drained. I don't think I have the resources to fight a deep depressive episode while searching for jobs. That's not something you can always control. Still, you can mitigate the likelihood by keeping your body and mood mentally healthy.

Sometimes I seek out experiences I might not be able to have otherwise. I find a trail and hike it on a Tuesday morning; I go for long bike rides in the middle of the day and listen to audiobooks. I pop into a shop or take the time to cook a really delicious meal.

### At the end
I'm lucky enough that there has always been an endpoint to my unemployment period. I'm even fortunate that it usually happens before my savings run out. The time after securing/accepting/signing the job offer, before my start date, is what I call "funemployment" -- where the worries really diminish. Admittedly, I do keep interviewing for other opportunities where I'm already in the pipeline. But I stop searching as intently and will only apply to something new if it's _really_ appealing. Otherwise, I do all the things I might've wanted to do during the past months but hadn't allowed myself. I get a few new clothes if I have the budget and need it; I might do a short vacation and really lounge. I rest and relax and get ready to start again.

I often do a bit of reflecting. Going through unemployment is hard and scary every time. Losing your job in an unexpected, uncontrolled way is jarring. I bring some of that trauma into my next job with me; it's almost inevitable. I process some of these tricky emotions and work on things that'll make me more resilient.
